## Sitcom Smart Language Processer

This project has the intent of making a smart program that can read sitcom scripts and start making its own episodes. There are a couple of variables to keep in mind when making this.
  * What kind of personality does each character have?
  * How do the character's interact with one another?
  * Where do these character's interact with one another?
  * Do they act differently in different places?
